Current Cost EnviR reader tool
==============================

This is a simple command line tool for fetching the current energy usage, temperature and time from a Current Cost EnviR electricity usage meter.

It has been tested against the EnviR meter, but may well work with other meters in the current cost range.
	
Usage:
------
	
	python current-cost.py [-t timeout] [-p serial-port] [-b baudrate] [-o "formatted list of output"]

Where:

 * timeout: is max time to wait for a reading (Default 10 seconds)
 * serial-port: Serial port that the meter is connected to (default /dev/ttyUSB0)
 * baudrate: Speed to connect to device (default 57600, which you shouldn't need to change unless you're using a different meter)

Format string similar to 'Energy Now: {{option}}, Temperature: {{option}}'

Limitations:
------------

 * This has been tested against the EnviR, but may well work with other devices in the range (if you change the baud rate).
 * Currently this only supports one sensor connected to the device.

Requirements:
-------------
 
 * Python 3
 * pySerial
